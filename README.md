## Open the "q2.cpp"

Complete the following functions to do the following works:

The program will take three user numbers and then finds the min number among these values. We need to develop three functions as follows:

1. get three user numbers

void getInput(int &n1, int &n2, int &n3);  
// In this function, ask the user three values and assign them to the parameter n1, n2, and n3

2. find the minimum number and return to the main function.

int  findMin(int n1, int n2, int n3);  
// The return value : the min among n1, n2 and n3.

3. Print the results

void printResult(int n1, int n2, int n3, int min);  
// Print out the results with the original numbers and the minimum value

4. Make the main function to drive all these functions.

// In main( ), call the functions  
getInput(n1, n2, n3);  
min = findMin(n1, n2, n3);  
printResult(n1, n2, n3, min);

- Program Source File:  Upload to the Github Classroom.
  - It will not be tested unless the filename is q2.cpp
- Make sure that you pass all test units after commit/push.
  - Click the "XX Commits" in your Git Classroom Repository. Find the ✔️ mark in the Git history.
  - When you see the icon ❌ on the Git browser, fix your errors in your VS Code and then commit/push again.
  - There must be multiple times commit/push to pass all test units.
